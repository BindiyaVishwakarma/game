        <h1> "INTERNATIONAL INDIGENOUS DAY"</h1>
        <h2 ><P>International Day of the World's Indigenous Peoples, also known as International Indigenous Day, is observed on August 9th each year.
             This day was first proclaimed by the United Nations General Assembly in December 1994, with the aim of promoting and protecting the
              rights of the worldâ€™s indigenous population. It also recognizes the achievements and contributions that indigenous peoples make to
               improve world issues, such as environmental protection.</P>
               <P>Each year, the UN chooses a theme to highlight different aspects of indigenous peoples' lives and rights. Events and activities
                 are organized around the world, ranging from cultural performances and exhibitions to seminars and discussions on the challenges
                  indigenous communities face.</P>
               <P>The day is an opportunity to celebrate the diverse cultures, languages, and traditions of indigenous peoples while also raising
                 awareness about the issues they continue to encounter, including marginalization, discrimination, and threats to their land and resources.</P></h2>

                <h1>BIRSA MUNDA: THE TRIBAL FREEDAM FIGHTER</h1>
                <P><h2>Birsa Munda was born on November 15, 1875, in Ulihatu, Jharkhand. Belonging to the Munda tribe, he witnessed the
                     exploitation of his people by British colonizers and landlords. Determined to protect his community's rights, Birsa led 
                     a movement in the late 1890s called "Ulgulan" or the "Great Tumult" to resist these oppressors. His leadership sparked a 
                     widespread tribal rebellion.Captured by the British, Birsa died in custody on June 9, 1900, at just 25 years old. Despite 
                     his short life, Birsa Munda remains a symbol of resistance and tribal pride. November 15th is celebrated as "Birsa Munda Jayanti"
                      in his honor.</P></h2>
